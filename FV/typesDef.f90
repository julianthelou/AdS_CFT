! The typesDef module is a global storage for runtime variables and compile time parameters.
! Here in the CCZ4 ExaHyPE application, it is a remnant of the much larger typesDef from the
! Trento code.
! By using ISO C bindings, we can access these global variables with a well-defined name from C.
! They are subsequently set at initialization.

      REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: CCZ4f         ! set f=0.75 or f=1.0 for the gamma driver. Typical BSSNOK value: f=0.75. Set f=0 to avoid shift evolution, i.e. to have d/dt beta^i=0.

      REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: CCZ4xi        ! set to zero to switch off the gamma driver and to avoid shift evolution (i.e. to have d/dt b^i = 0) 
      REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: CCZ4e         ! cleaning speed e>=1 for the Hamiltonian constraint. Typical value for CCZ4 is e=1. However, e>1 gives better constraints and better hyperbolicity!

      REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: CCZ4ds        ! set this value always to ds=1, unless you know what you are doing. It allows to increase the cleaning speed for the momentum constraints, but in CCZ4 this does not seem to do what it should do...
